Cancion chanchan = Cancion(title: "chan chan", lyrics: '''De Alto Cedro voy para Marcané
Llego a Cueto, voy para Mayarí
De Alto Cedro voy para Marcané
Llego a Cueto, voy para Mayarí
De Alto Cedro voy para Marcané
Llego a Cueto, voy para Mayarí
El cariño que te tengo
No te lo puedo negar
Se me sale la babita
Yo no lo puedo evitar
Cuando Juanica y Chan Chan
En el mar cernían arena
Como sacudía el jibe
A Chan Chan le daba pena
Limpia el camino de pajas
Que yo me quiero sentar
En aquel tronco que veo
Y así no puedo llegar
De alto Cedro voy para Marcané
Llego a Cueto, voy para Mayarí
De alto Cedro voy para Marcané
Llego a Cueto, voy para Mayarí''', url: "https://youtu.be/tGbRZ73NvlY", genre: 'son');

Cancion shapeOfYou =Cancion(title: "shape of you", lyrics: '''The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
Come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
(Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I)
I'm in love with your body
(Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I)
I'm in love with your body
(Oh-I-oh-I-oh-I-oh-I)
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you
One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
And leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead''', url: "https://youtu.be/JGwWNGJdvx8", genre: "pop");

Cancion loseYourself=Cancion(title: "Lose yourself", lyrics: '''Look
If you had one shot, or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted
One moment
Would you capture it or just let it slip?
Yo
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready to drop bombs
But he keeps on forgetting what he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's choking how, everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow!
Snap back to reality
Oh, there goes gravity
Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked
He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy, no
He won't have it, he knows his whole back's to these ropes
It don't matter, he's dope
He knows that but he's broke
He's so stagnant, he knows when he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's
Back to the lab again, yo
This whole rhapsody
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better
The soul's escaping, through this hole that is gaping
This world is mine for the taking
Make me king, as we move toward a new world order
A normal life is boring, but superstardom's close to post mortem
It only grows harder, homie grows hotter
He blows, it's all over
These hoes is all on him
Coast to coast shows, he's known as the globetrotter
Lonely roads, God only knows
He's knows is grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water
His hoes don't want him no more, he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose dove and sold nada
So the soap opera is told and unfolds
I suppose it's old partner but the beat goes on
Da da dum, da dum da da
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better
No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
Tear this motherfucking roof off like two dogs caged
I was playing in the beginning, the mood all changed
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
But I kept rhyming and stepped right into the next cypher
Best believe somebody's paying the pied piper
All the pain inside amplified by the fact
That I can't get by with my 9-to-5
And I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And it's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's getting even harder
Trying to feed and water my seed, plus
Teeter totter caught up between being a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama's screaming on and
Too much for me to wanna stay in one spot, another day of monotony
Has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail I've got to formulate a plot or I end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfucking option, failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got to go
I cannot grow old in Salem's lot
So here I go it's my shot
Feet, fail me not, this may be the only opportunity that I got
You better
Lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better lose yourself in the music, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime
You better
You can do anything you set your mind to, man''', url: "https://youtu.be/_Yhyp-_hX2s", genre: "rap");


Cancion elAzul =Cancion(title: "El azul", lyrics: 
'''Compa Junior
Pura doble P viejo
Que siga la mata dando viejo
Qué detallazo pa' mensajear con la muerte
Una con siete chinos que de retrato trae
Al señor de la montaña, de los drones y demás
Cuernos del diablo junto a mi seguridad
Viejo lobo en verguiza para el polvo traficar
Dios siempre me cuida y mi gorrita de Elegua
En la sangre traigo el 701
Melena de león, pues vengo de uno
Siempre amafiado, pues no somos culos
Bajo perfil el chavalón y se le extraña
Aunque se fue, nunca se le olvida
Bélicos ya somos, bélicos morimos
Y con el corridón del ángel azul
A Dios le pido perdón por los pecados
Pero así es esto
Aya yay!
Pura doble P viejo
Puro Junior H viejo
Rolls-Royce azul
Como el de aquellos botones
Que pa' la finiquera seguido ya han de brincar
Me enamoró el dinero, quiero, quiero y quiero más
Cuernos del diablo y un comando mi seguridad
Viejo lobo en verguiza para el polvo traficar
Dios siempre me cuida y mi gorrita de Elegua
En la sangre traigo el 701
Melena de un león, pues vengo de uno
Siempre amafiados, pues no somos culos
Bajo perfil el chavalón y se le extraña
A un Ruíz, el que nunca se olvida
Bélicos somos, bélicos morimos
Y con el corridón del ángel azul
Le pido perdón a mi Dios por los pecados
Pero así es esto''', url: "https://youtu.be/UMDwOQ77XcM", genre: "corridos");

Cancion itWasAGoodDay =Cancion(title: "it was a good day", lyrics: '''Break 'em! Shit!
Yo! Yeah!
Just wakin' up in the mornin', gotta thank God
I don't know but today seems kinda odd
No barkin' from the dog, no smog
And momma cooked a breakfast with no hog
I got my grub on, but didn't pig out
Finally, got a call from a girl I wanna dig out
Hooked it up fo' later as I hit the do'
Thinkin', "Will I live another 24'?"
I gotta go 'cause I got me a drop top
And if I hit the switch, I can make the ass drop
Had to stop, at a red light
Lookin' in my mirror, not a jacker in sight
And everything is alright
I got a beep from Kim, and she can fuck all night
Called up the homies, and I'm askin' y'all
Which park, are y'all playin' basketball?
Get me on the court and I'm trouble
Last week fucked around and got a triple-double
Freakin' niggas every way like MJ
I can't believe, today was a good day, shit!
Drove to the pad and hit the showers
Didn't even get no static from them cowards
'Cause just yesterday, them fools tried to blast me
Saw the police, and they rolled right past me
No flexin', didn't even look in a nigga's direction
As I ran the intersection
Went to Short Dog's house, they was watchin' Yo! MTV Raps
What's the haps on the craps?
Shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em!
Roll 'em in a circle of niggas, and watch me break 'em
Wit' the seven, 7-11, 7-11
Seven, even back do' Lil Joe
I picked up the cash flow
Then we played bones, and I'm yellin' "Domino!"
Plus nobody I know got killed in South Central LA
Today was a good day, shit!
Left my nigga's house paid
Picked up a girl been tryna fuck since the 12th grade
It's ironic, I had the brew, she had the chronic
The Lakers beat the Supersonics
I felt on her big fat fanny
Pulled out the jammy and killed the punani
And my dick runs deep, so deep, so deep
Put her ass to sleep
Woke her up around one
She didn't hesitate to call Ice Cube the top gun
Drove her to the pad and I'm coastin'
Took another sip of the potion, hit the three-wheel motion
I was glad everything had worked out
Dropped her ass off, and then chirped out
Today was like one of those fly dreams
Didn't even see a berry flashin' those high beams
No helicopter lookin' for a murder
Two in the mornin', got the Fatburger
Even saw the lights of the Goodyear Blimp
And it read, "Ice Cube's a Pimp!" (yeah)
Drunk as hell, but no throwin' up
Halfway home, and my pager's still blowin' up
Today, I didn't even have to use my AK
I gotta say it was a good day, shit!
Hey, wait, wait a minute!
Pooh, stop this shit!
What the fuck am I thinkin' about?''', url: 'https://youtu.be/h4UqMyldS7Q', genre: 'Hip Hop');
